## Documentation
### Seed Phrase Generation
SeedGn uses cryptographic algorithms to generate secure seed phrases for different blockchain networks. These seed phrases act as the master keys for accessing and managing your wallets.

### Balance Checking
The tool communicates with the specified blockchain networks to retrieve the current balances associated with the generated seed phrases. If a wallet has funds, SeedGn records the address, mnemonic, private key, and balances for future reference.

### Wallet Information Persistence
When SeedGn identifies a wallet with a non-zero balance, it logs the relevant details to a file named `result.txt`. This file serves as a record of wallets that have been discovered during the balance checking process.
